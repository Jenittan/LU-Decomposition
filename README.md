# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Algorithm i) step1 find the 1 and u matirx by using numpy and linalg from scipy

step2 print the 1 matrix and u matirx

step3 find the lu decomposition by using numpy and lu_factor and lu_solve

step4 print the the following matrix

ii) step1 In second program can import lo factor and lu selve from python library as same as in second program.

step2 Get the input from user in the form of nested list to compute numpy array format and declare it for both the variables

step3 Step Create the variable to Use inputted array to compute of lu, factor of matrix varaible.

step4 Step Create the new variable for a solve to compute of x variable and b' variable.

step5 Steps Print the corresponding variable (solution) to get the output
